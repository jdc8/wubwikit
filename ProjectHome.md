# WubWikit #
This projects bundles Wub and wikitcl as a Tcl zip-file. It allows you to run your own wiki as web based application using Wub.

To run using the zip you'll need:

  * A tclsh based on Tcl/Tk version 8.6 (cvs head), including TDBC (e.g. from http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads)
  * TDBC::sqlite3 version 1.0b16 (included in zip)
  * sqlite 3.7.3 (from ActiveState teapot)
