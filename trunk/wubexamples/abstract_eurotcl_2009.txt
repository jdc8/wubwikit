Abstract text * :

Since the 'Great Wiki Meltdown' in the spring of 2007, the Tcler's Wiki has been
running on Wub. Written by Colin McCormack, Wub is a pure Tcl Http 1.1
webserver, a successor of TclHttpd. It makes heavy use of bleeding edgd Tcl
(8.6) features such as dicts, co-routines, zlib and TclOO. Wub comes with a lot
of what it calls 'Domains': pluggable building blocks adding new functionality.

This talk will not focus on the inner workings of Wub, but will take a
step-by-step approach on runnig Wub and using its domains to make Web
applications.

Topics covered:

- Getting Wub

- Runtime requirements

- Running Wub out-of-the-box

- Configuring your web application with 'Nubs': domain, rewrite, redirect

- Using the 'File' domain

- Templating with the 'Mason' domain

- Mapping URL's to Tcl commands using the 'Direct' domain

- The Wub API

- Adding 'JQuery' to your Web application with the 'jQ' domain

- Init parameters

- More 'Nubs' (block, literal, code) and interactive introspection

- Using the 'Convert' domain for content transformation

    - Tie: web interface on namespaces

    - Coco: mapping co-routines to URL's

    - Honeypot: catch bad spiders

    - Repo: a file repository

    - stx: a wiki-inspired format to specify html documents
